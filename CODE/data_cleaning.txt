For data cleaning, we followed the steps below in OpenRefine and Dataiku.

Great Schools Data:
Data was aggregated to the zip code level and each zip code contains the average school rating for all schools in the zip code.

Experian Data:
Data was filtered so that only the relevant columns remained. We also renamed columns for better readability and understandability.

Zillow Data:
We identified the important columns present in each dataset and removed the other (unimportant) columns. After this, we removed any zip code that had missing values for the important columns.
The 10 cleaned datasets were then merged together with SQL. We used an inner join to ensure that our final dataset only included zip codes we had complete information for.
After the Zillow data was joined, we did an inner join with the Great Schools data and then another inner join with the Experian data.




For scoring our metrics:

Each variable that we used in our recommendation algorithm was scaled from 0 to 1. For all variables except for the age of the house, 0 represents the lowest value and 1 represents the highest.
For the average age of the home variable, we assigned a 1 to older homes built after 1978 (to avoid lead paint and asbestos) and scaled down to 0 as homes either became newer or older than 1978.
